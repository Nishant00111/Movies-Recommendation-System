## Movie Recommendation System with Deep Learning and Cosine Similarity
## Description
This project implements a movie recommendation system using deep learning and cosine similarity. It leverages deep learning to understand user preferences and cosine similarity to recommend movies that are similar to those the user has liked.

## Data Collection: The system collects movie data, including user ratings and movie features.

## Deep Learning Model: A deep learning model, such as a neural collaborative filtering (NCF) model, is trained on the user ratings data to capture user preferences and movie features.

## Cosine Similarity: The system uses cosine similarity to find movies that are similar to those the user has rated highly. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors and is used to identify movies with similar features.

## Recommendation: Based on the user's past preferences and cosine similarity, the system generates movie recommendations.
